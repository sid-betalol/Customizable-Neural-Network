# Custom Classes to create a Neural Network using NumPy
I have created classes which can be used to create a neural network architecture of your choice. You can use these classes to define your own layers, activation functions, backpropagation algorithms. 

This can be used as a reference of the tasks performed: https://wandb.ai/cs6910_2023/A1/reports/CS6910-Assignment-1--VmlldzozNTI2MDc5

I am contsantly updating this Wandb report as I carry out experiments: https://wandb.ai/sidbetala/cs6910-assignment1/reports/CS6910-Assignment-1--VmlldzozODMzNDQ2
